## [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/)

A weekly blog about swift development by John Sundell. They're short and easily digestable blogs. Just enough explanation to understand, as well as examples and code snippets to go along with it.

## [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/)

If you learn best by doing, this is the site for you. They have a lot of step-by-step tutorials that cover a lot of the core topics. It's everything you'd ever need to get your foot in the door to build and ship your first app.

## [Unsure Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNWv52iO_OAdZ12kslG4Cg/videos)

A lot of really good React Native tutorials. He goes through some pretty cool animation recreations, and has a few Redux tutorials.

## [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com)

Some of the classes on Udemy are worth the price if they're having a sale. I wouldn't ever buy a class that is $100+, but when they're on sale for like $10 that's when I consider purchasing. Here are a few classes I have gone through or working through and recommend:

* [Android App Development using Kotlin](https://www.udemy.com/android-oreo-kotlin-app-masterclass/)
* [The Complete React Native and Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/)
* [iOS 10 & Swift 3: From Beginner to Paid Professionl](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/)
