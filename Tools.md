## [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## [OmniDiskSweeper](https://www.omnigroup.com/more)

If you're running out of disk space on your computer, this will sweep your computer to show you the directories that have the most memory usage. I use this quite often to clean up a lot of Xcode directories.

## [MarvelApp](https://marvelapp.com/)

I use this to mockup the apps I build in my spare time. It has a free option, but it limits you to only two projects

## [Expo](https://expo.io/)

A tool for React Native projects. Expo makes it super easy to start, build, and develop a React Native project. You can also post your projects on their website, and although I haven't published a RN app yet, they also have instructions to push to both the Play Store and the App Store

## VSCode Extensions
