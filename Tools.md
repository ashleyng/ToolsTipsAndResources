## [OmniDiskSweeper](https://www.omnigroup.com/more)

If you're running out of disk space on your computer, this will sweep your computer to show you the directories that have the most memory usage. I use this quite often to clean up a lot of Xcode directories.

## [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)

I actually held out on buying Sketch for the longest time, and just got by with their free trial. It wasn't till I watched a YouTube tutorial that I realized the power behind Sketch. I use it for mockup as well as creating background images, logos, and icon. 

## [MarvelApp](https://marvelapp.com/)

I use this to mockup the apps I build in my spare time. It has a free option, but it limits you to only two projects

## AppStore Screenshot Creators

These tools make it easy to create screenshots to submit to the AppStore. There are pros and cons to each, but they all work really well.

* [AppInstitue](https://screenshot-maker.appinstitute.com)
* [AppLaunch](https://theapplaunchpad.com)
* [MockUPhone](https://mockuphone.com)

## [Privacy Policy Creator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/#)

Now that Apple requires all apps submit a privacy, this app generates one for you with commonly used 3rd-party tools such as Firebase, Fabric, Crashlytics and more.

## [Expo](https://expo.io/)

A tool for React Native projects. Expo makes it super easy to start, build, and develop a React Native project. You can also post your projects on their website, and although I haven't published a RN app yet, they also have instructions to push to both the Play Store and the App Store
