# Tools
## [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh)
Share images of your source code. Wide selection of color themes and languages to choose from.

## [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
Choose between different color harmonies to find colors that go well together.

## [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
A framework to manage zsh configurations, but let's be real, we all probably only use this for the terminal themes.

## [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)
Save articles, videos, and stories from any web page. I primarily use it to save articles to read.

## BetterSnapTool/Magnet
MacOS apps that allows you to snap windows to areas of the screen (left half, left two-thirds, right half, top half, etc), and both support keyboard shortcuts.

[Magnet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)
## [MarvelApp](https://marvelapp.com/)
I use this to mockup the apps I build in my spare time. It has a free option, but it limits you to only two projects
## [Expo](https://expo.io/)
A tool for React Native projects. Expo makes it super easy to start, build, and develop a React Native project. You can also post your projects on their website, and although I haven't published a RN app yet, they also have instructions to push to both the Play Store and the App Store
## VSCode Extensions
Even though I'm primarily a native mobile developer, I occassionally do React Native or React development, or just need to use it for other things. Here are a few extensions I use:
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
* [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)
## Chrome Extensions
Extensions I have installed
* [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)
* [ChromeiQL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeiql/fkkiamalmpiidkljmicmjfbieiclmeij)
* [New Tab Draft](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-draft/nmfjkeiebceinkbggliapgfdjphocpdh)


# Tips
## XCode Playground Scratchpad
Add a Playground to your dock to easily access to test concepts. Here's a snippet of some things I have in my scratchpad (don't ask why I have them).

## Version Managers
**ALWAYS USE THEM!!!** I have nvm and rvm setup for my local development. When apps and repos have different requirements to build, using a version manager is a lifesaver.
## [Slack Themes](https://slackthemes.net)
Are you not creative enough to make your own Slack theme? Are there too many color choices for you to actually pick and make your own color theme? [slackthemes.net](https://slackthemes.net) have pre-made themes and you just need to copy the color codes into your Slack preferences.

# Resources
## [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/)
A weekly blog about swift development by John Sundell. They're short and easily digestable blogs. Just enough explanation to understand, as well as examples and code snippets to go along with it. 
## [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/)
If you learn best by doing, this is the site for you. They have a lot of step-by-step tutorials that cover a lot of the core topics. It's everything you'd ever need to get your foot in the door to build and ship your first app. 
## [Unsure Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNWv52iO_OAdZ12kslG4Cg/videos)
A lot of really good React Native tutorials. He goes through some pretty cool animation recreations, and has a few Redux tutorials.
