Some Git aliases I use. I just started using aliases (May 2019), so they will probably evolve overtime.

```
s = status
c = clone
co = checkout
cob = checkout -b
a = add
cmm = commit -m
d = diff
dc = diff --cached
pl = pull
ps = push
b = branch
pf = push -f
cma = comment --amend
a = add
l = log
co-- = checkout --
```
